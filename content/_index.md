# Welcome!

Hack Monmouth is a group of people from the local community coming together to hack, learn, teach, share, and discuss technology and how it can be used to build stronger communities.

## Join us!

We're on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/futuremonmouth/) (mainly used for updates on events etc) and on [Slack](https://hackmonmouthslacksignup.herokuapp.com/) (for discussion of tools, projects, problems, and everything else that overflows from meetups!).
