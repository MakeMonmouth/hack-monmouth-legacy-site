Hack Monmouth was setup in 2018 by a group of like-minded people who saw a future for Monmouth that lay outside the traditional local industries.

Our goal is to provide a space in Monmouth where people from all walks of life can meet to tinker, hack, make, craft, and discuss the impact of what we do on the future of the town.

We aim to be a fully inclusive community group, and require all attendees to sign up to our Code of Conduct.

We meet twice a fortnight, and details of our up-coming meetings can be found on our events page.
